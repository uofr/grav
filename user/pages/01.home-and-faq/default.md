This website is intended to be used as a resource for writing research style biology lab reports.

The guidelines given here are the same guidelines you will follow when you describe original research as a practising biologist. They are a combination of accepted practices for scientific report writing, and simple tips for clear writing.

!!! While different instructors have slightly different guidelines for writing lab reports, the general guidelines on this website provide an overview of effective lab report writing practices.
